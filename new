#create new items in a way that tracks them for automatic backup

#ex.
#$>new repo RepoName
#translates to
#$>git init ~/Projects/Code RepoName
#then add it to a tracked repos file so backup knows to run save on that repo with an automated message

#$>new folder Projects/Blog
#translates to 
#$>make the folder locally, and add it to a file of tracked folders to be mirrored
